# CNN_Model_Layer_Information_Generator
This repository consists of colab notebook that is used to generate CNN files for Optical Neural Network Simulator

Functions provided can interpret any keras model to extract each layer information such as filter or kernel dimensions, input dimensions, output dimensions, dot product compution requirement etc and creates a csv file that can be provided to simulators like B_ONN_SIM(Binary Optical Neural Network Simulator)
